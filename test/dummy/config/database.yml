# UMLAUT: mysql db with mysql2 adapter strongly recommended for Umlaut, in both 
# production and development. sqlite3 has unclear semantics under threaded 
# concurrency which umlaut uses, and in many cases simply does not work. 
#
# A higher pool size than ordinary is recommended because of umlaut's
# use of concurrency. Perhaps as large as the number of services
# you have configured to run in the same wave, plus another few.

# development:
#   adapter: mysql2
#   host: 
#   username:
#   password:
#   database:
#   pool: 15 

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.

# UMLAUT: for the 'search' functions (A-Z title lookup) to work, you need
# a direct database connection to the SFX database, under 'sfx_db' key. 
# You should manually set up a new read-only MySQL account in the SFX db
# for this purpose, rather than use one of the full-access existing SFX
# mysql accounts.
